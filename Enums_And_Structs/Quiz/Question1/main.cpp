/* In designing a game, we decide we want to have monsters,
because everyone likes fighting monsters.
Declare a struct that represents your monster.
The monster should have a type that can be one of the following:
an ogre, a dragon, an orc, a giant spider, or a slime. Use an enum class for
this.

Each individual monster should also have a name
(use a std::string or std::string_view),
as well as an amount of health that represents how much damage they can take
before they die.
Write a function named printMonster() that prints out all of the structâ€™s
members. Instantiate an ogre and a slime, initialize them using an initializer
list, and pass them to printMonster(). */
