# Note:- Do not use cstring unless you really need and know what you are doing.
PREFER std::string or std::string_view
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are different inbuilt functions to manipulate to C-style strings 
under the <cstring> Header. They are:-


  1. strcpy(): used to copy a string to another string.
      syntax:- 
        strcpy(destination, source);
strcpy an easily cause array overflow , suppose dest not having enough size for source to be 
copied. There are other alternatives like strncpy(),strcpy_s(),strlcpy() etc, but they all
do have their own issues. In conclusion, there is no perfect universal solution for copying
string.
